#summary Motivation

Main points:

== simple ==

You can write any UTF-8 text that you want, including all special characters, accents, whatever, except:

  * "<" needs to be written as "&lt;"
  * & needs to be written as "&amp;"

This means you no longer have to worry about escaping characters like "$", "\", "^" and you don't have to use some hard to remember markup for accented characters. You simply write UTF-8 (but you can use XML entities if you want, like "&ouml;" for "รถ")

== easy to parse in a program ==

Because of the simple structure above, it's easy to parse and you can use standard tools for that in Python, e.g the `python-lxml` library.

== content separation ==

You concentrate on content and let the converter handle the rest. The default converter
in `prettydoc` does a good job and you can customize it's output as easily as deriving a simple Python class.
