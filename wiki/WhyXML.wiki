#summary Motivation

Main points:

== simple ==

You can write any UTF-8 text that you want, including all special characters, accents, whatever, except:

  * "<" needs to be written as "&lt;"
  * & needs to be written as "&amp;"

== easy to parse in a program ==

Because of the simple structure above, it's easy to parse and you can use standard tools for that in Python, e.g the `python-lxml` library.
